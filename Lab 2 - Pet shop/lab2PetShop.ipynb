        "  This ER diagram shows the entities needed in a petshop’s database with its attributes and relationship between one another. In this database, Pets, Customers, and Food are the main subject, while Enclosure and Food serves as an additional information to Pets entity, and PetPurchase and FoodPurchase are both end-user entities that shows a transaction between the other four main entities. Enclosure entity gives the Pets entity information in terms of where each pets live/placed, hence the relationship name “lives”. Food entity gives the Pets entity information in terms of the specific food every pets eat, hence the relationship name “feed”. PetPurchase entity involves Pets and Customers entities, having “purchase” both as their relationship name because pets are being purchased in the PetPurchase and customers are the ones who purchased it. Similarly, FoodPurchase involves Food and Customers entities, also having “purchase” as their relationship name. As how the owner of the pet shop wants it, PetPurchase and FoodPurchase are set up separately."
